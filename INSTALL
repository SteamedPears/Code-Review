Installation Instructions
=========================

Development
-----------

Requirements:
(tested versions appear in parentheses)

 * unix (OS X 10.6.8, OS X 10.8.2, Fedora 18)
 * node (v0.8.17, v0.8.20)
 * npm (1.2.11)
 * node-gyp (v0.8.4)
 * sqlite3 (3.7.15.1, 3.7.13)
 * g++ (4.7.2)
 * GNU Wget (1.14)
 * sed (FreeBSD)

Instructions:

 1. open a terminal
 2. cd to the root directory of the project (containing this text
    file).
 3. Run bin/start_dev.sh

Now you should be able to access the server running on localhost:8080.

If you would like to stop the server, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/stop_dev.sh as the final step.

If you would like to restart the server, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/restart_dev.sh as the final step.

If something has gone horribly wrong, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/reset_dev.sh as the final step.  WARNING!!!  This
will destroy your development database and delete the locally
installed npm modules.  This is the best way to bring your
installation back to a known state, but you will lose all the data in
your copy of the application.



Production
----------

Requirements:

 * unix (Server uses CentOS release 5.8 (Final))
 * node (Server uses v0.6.18)
 * nginx (Server uses ??)
 * MySQL (Server uses Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.0.95, for redhat-linux-gnu
   (i686) using readline 5.1)

Instructions:

(Assuming ssh'd into server, pulled latest repo and reading this.)

 1. cd to root directory
 2. run bin/update_server.sh


Troubleshooting
---------------

After running bin/server/start_dev.sh for the first time, if you get the following error `Error: Cannot find module '../build/Release/node_sqlite3.node'`, you may need to build the node sqlite3 module.

 1. Install node-gyp: `sudo npm install -g node-gyp`
 2. Navigate to bin/server/node_modules_sqlite3/
 3. Run `./configure` and `./make`
