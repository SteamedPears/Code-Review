    file).
 3. Run bin/start_dev.sh

Now you should be able to access the server running on localhost:8080.

If you would like to stop the server, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/stop_dev.sh as the final step.

If something has gone horribly wrong, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/reset_dev.sh as the final step.  WARNING!!!  This
will destroy your development database and delete the locally
installed npm modules.  This is the best way to bring your
installation back to a known state, but you will lose all the data in
your copy of the application.
