Installation Instructions
=========================

Development
-----------

Requirements:
(tested versions appear in parentheses)

 * unix (OS X 10.6.8, OS X 10.8.2, Fedora 18)
 * node (v0.8.17, v0.8.20)
 * npm (1.2.11)
 * node-gyp (v0.8.4)
 * redis (2.6.10)
 * gcc (4.7.2)
 * GNU Wget (1.14)

Instructions:

 1. open a terminal
 2. cd to the root directory of the project (containing this text
    file).
 3. Run bin/start_dev.sh

Now you should be able to access the server running on localhost:8080.

If you would like to stop the server, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/stop_dev.sh as the final step.

If you would like to restart the server, simply run bin/start_dev.sh again.

If something has gone horribly wrong, follow the above instructions
but instead run bin/reset_dev.sh as the final step.  WARNING!!!  This
will destroy your development database and delete the locally
installed npm modules.  This is the best way to bring your
installation back to a known state, but you will lose all the data in
your copy of the application.
