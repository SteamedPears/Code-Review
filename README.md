# Code Review

Code Review is for reviewing code.
Someone uploads code; then people can comment on selections of the code.
Later reviewers can see previous comments, too, and comment on those, forming
comment threads.

* The web client will request resources and make JSON queries. It will render
the UI.
* The web server will respond to JSON queries with JSON descriptions of the
stored data, and translate JSON commands to a database command language for the
backend store. Also, it will serve web resources -- hence the name.
* The backend store will keep the code and comments. It may also store extra
data such as reserved usernames, if we implement that.

See http://review.steamedpears.com for the prototype.
