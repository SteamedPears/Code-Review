# Code Review

Code Review is for reviewing code.
Someone uploads code; then people can comment on selections of the code.
Later reviewers can see previous comments, too, and comment on those, forming
comment threads.

* The web client will request resources and make JSON queries. It will render
the UI.
* The web server will respond to JSON queries with JSON descriptions of the
stored data, and translate JSON commands to a database command language for the
backend store. Also, it will serve web resources -- hence the name.
* The backend store will keep the code and comments. It may also store extra
data such as reserved usernames, if we implement that.

See http://review.steamedpears.com for the prototype.

# Documentation

Our project's documentation is spread out through the project in a component
specific way. Installation instructions for the server side component are
located in `./INSTALL`. All docs relating to building and developing the
bookmarklet are in `./src/bookmarklet/README.md`. Usage instructions for the
client component can be found in the tutorial available to new users.

All of Code Review's code adheres to a strict [coding
standard](https://github.com/CarletonU-COMP2406-W2013/Steamed-Pears/wiki/Coding-Standards).
We've documented our [development
process](https://github.com/CarletonU-COMP2406-W2013/Steamed-Pears/wiki/Process)
and [server
API](https://github.com/CarletonU-COMP2406-W2013/Steamed-Pears/wiki/Server-API).
Please visit the
[wiki](https://github.com/CarletonU-COMP2406-W2013/Steamed-Pears/wiki) for more details.

All remaining [required
documentation](http://homeostasis.scs.carleton.ca/wiki/index.php/WebFund_2013W_Final_Project) is located in the `./docs` folder.
